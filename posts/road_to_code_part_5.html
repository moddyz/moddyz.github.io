            <p>It was late summer of 2010.  An intense wave of humidity wooshes over.  Welcome to Guangzhou.</p>

            <p>A driver picked Uncle G. and I up at the airport to take us to our accomodations.  I try to make some small talk with the driver but we have trouble understanding eachother - should have definitely studied harder during those Saturday chinese classes in Vancouver.  We arrived in a large residential community, which is actually in the city of Foshan.  My senses were on fire - taking everything in - the trees, architecture, dialects, everything felt very different from home and from the China in my childhood memories.  There was a sense of freedom.</p>
          
            <p>The first thing we did after unpacking was head over to a restaurant to meet a couple other folks.  We tried some dishes I've never seen before.  The flavor was explosive.  I'm going to like China.</p>

            <p>We rest over the weekend and come Monday it was time to go to work.  Because the residential community was so big, they had their own internal shuttle bus system which we took to a stop, and waited for another shuttle (also operated by the community) which connected to the city centre.  Again, all very new to me.  It was about an hour and a half until we reach the office building, near the Xiao Bei subway station.</p>

            <p>I meet my team lead, Xiao Feng, who has an art and VFX background.  He starts showing me some of the auto-stereoscopic stuff they've been working on right away.  Auto-sterescopic is basically 3D without glasses - it's pretty trippy especially when you see it for the first time.
