            <p>
            <p>It was May 2007, senior highschool year.  I wanted to become a digital concept artist but any steps towards making that a reality.</p>
            <p>My above-average drawing skills were far from good enough to enroll into any respectable art institute.  Am I going to end up doing nothing for a whole year?</p>

            <p>A family friend recommended the Digital Animation program at the public Capilano College (now University) which required a balance of tech and art skills.</p>
            <p>My dad dragged me to meet their head of program.  By some divine intervention, they needed to fill one spot because someone had dropped out.  I was back in the race.</p>

            <p>The Digital Animation program in '08 was a 8-month intensive with final project to present at a job fair.  Half of the class already had industry experience working in animation, games, and visual effects - I knew I had to apply myself to keep up.</p>
          
            <p>There was one amazing concept artist in the class who had years of professional experience.  Upon seeing his works, <span class="key-moment">I quickly realized that my dream of becoming a concept artist was not realistic</span> -- a) it's a highly sought after role with companies only employ a few and b) I was really not <em>that</em> good at drawing.</p>

            <p>The daily, long commutes on the bus gave time to think of other ways to apply creativity.</p>

            <p>The year blew past learning about tools like Maya, XSI, and all the disciplines around creating digital and animated content.  My liked character modeling so for my final project I made a short reel based the main character from Final Fantasy 13 Versus (later known as 15).  Constructing his hair to subtly move in the wind was my first exposure to the technical side of computer graphics where one of the teachers demonstrated how to simulate curves which in turn deformed polygonal hair strips.

            <p>There were a couple long nights to polish things up before the job fair in April. The day itself was intense, relieving, and a celebratory moment.</p>

            <p>Job hunting is never easy.  There was radio silence for about 4 months until Nerd Corps Entertainment called about a Render Wrangler position.  Another lucky break.  I took the opportunity and landed my first full-time job.</p>
