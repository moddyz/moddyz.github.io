        <h1>Accidental Coder Part 3: What is a TD</h1>

        <p>I started at Nerd Corps Entertainment as a Render Wrangler on the production "League of Super Evil".  They worked on kids animated TV series and at the time were fully on a Softimage XSI pipeline.</p>

        <p>A render wrangler's core responsibility was to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Submit jobs to render all the 3D elements in a given animation shot</li>
          <li>Collect those renders and roughly composite them together into a 2D frame sequence (this was called pre-comp)</li>
          <li>Check <em>frame-by-frame</em> for any issues - a common one being geometry penetration.  If there are issues:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Kick them back to an appropriate department (often Animation)</li>
              <li>...or fix them yourself (e.g. rotoscoping)</li>
            <ul>
        </ol>
      
        <p>It got mind numbing, and fast.  It was an entry level role after all.</p>

        <p>One day, the custom UI tool I was using did not behave as expected.  My team lead referred me to get help from our TDs. <span class="key-moment">What is a TD...?</span> I wondered.</p>
        <p>The TDs, Technical Directors, turned out to be two nice folks who could just fix about anything with "code" - more like magic.</p>
        <p>It felt like they were wielding a different class of creativity.  "I want to do that" - I thought.</p>
        
        <p>But how?  Do I go back to school?  Learn on the job?  I had only a few months of work experience.</p> 

        <p>By the 6th month at the studio, they started giving me some Compositing tasks.  While it was a breath of fresh air it wasn't the kind of problems that those TDs were solving.</p>
        <p>I quit.  One of the leaders was surprised and asked me if I was sure, and that most people try to accumulate at least 2 years of experience before moving on.  I was actually full of doubt - diving head first into what could, (and would) turn out to be years of unemployment.</p>

        <p>But, I needed to focus on the immediate thing at hand - how does one learn this coding thing?</p>
