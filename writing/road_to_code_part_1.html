            <p>I want to share my journey towards writing code professionally.  It was <em>not</em> an optimal recommended path.

            <p>Did you know what you wanted to do out of high school?  I certainly did not.</p>

            <p>I was off to a strong start in Grade 9 academically. My parents - highly educated Chinese immigrants - demanded excellence, and for a while, I delivered.  Good grades, math contests, the works.  The future felt full of possibility.</p>

            <p>Grade 10 hit, and some personal issues knocked me sideways. Grade 11 was worse: my mom banned me from playing basketball - the one thing keeping me sane - and I spiraled - I consciously let my grades tank almost as a way to get back at her.  C's on the report card became the norm.  I immersed into gaming - Defense of the Ancients and Starsiege Tribes weren't just hobbies anymore.</p>

            <p>By the time Grade 12 arrived, I watched most of my friends and classmates settle on their universities and majors.  I didn't want to end up homeless so had to pick <em>somethihng</em>.</p>

            <p>What about Art?  That was something.  My parents had enrolled me in traditional drawing classes on weekends throughout my childhood which I enjoyed.  I was back at it.</p>

            <p><span class="key-moment">Then, I stumbed upon Craig Mullins' website </span><a href="www.goodbrush.com">goodbrush.com</a> (now lost to internet history).  Loose, atmospheric, impossibly skilled. Here was someone painting sci-fi mechs and fantasy landscapes with the same confidence traditional painters brought to bowls of fruit.  It was exciting to know that someoneone making a living creating imaginary worlds.</p>

            <p>The decision was made.  I wanted to become a concept artist. Should be easy, right?</p>
